# Task Manager

This is a simple task manager!

The [server](./server) was taken from [Andrew Mead's node course](https://github.com/andrewjmead/node-course-v3-code) and was tweaked a bit by me, namely:

- [Feature] Added data ranges (start date and end date) to tasks;
- [Feature] Removed user's profile picture;
- [Feature] Removed "Welcome" and "Good bye" e-mails;
- [Enhancement] Added a LOT more tests;
- [Enhancement] Added custom output messages when a user tries to use an already existing e-mail;
- [Enhancement] Changed the way that (the non-exposure of) sensitive data is handled.

# Installation and more
