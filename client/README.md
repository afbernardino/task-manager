# Task Manager Client

## Installation

`npm i`

## Setup

Build the project with webpack by running the following command:

```
npm run build:dev - For development
npm run build:prod - For production
```

## Test

`npm test`

## Run on localhost

`npm run start`

Alternatively you can fire up the server by using the following command:

`npm run dev`

This will automatically build the project, each time a file as been changed, by enabling Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

Finally, access the http://localhost:3001 with your browser.
